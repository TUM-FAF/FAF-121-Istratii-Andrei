## The RoR Way

Ruby on Rails is a fast-growing web framework. At first glance it appeard to be somewhat complicated and with to much 'magic' involved, however after digging into the topic I was able to feel comfortable with it, and develop complex projects. The RoR comunity favours convention over configuration, what that means is basicaly that the framework takes care of a number of things in a way that is considered to be 'right', and the developer in consequence is left with an open field for focusing on the specifics of his project rather than setting up boiler-plate code. Over all RoR is an interesting platform and it is a pleasure to work with it.
